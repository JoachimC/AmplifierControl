## Watch for iTunes on Play / on Stop events (MacOS) and forward to RabbitMQ.

A little piece of home automation. When iTunes (MacOS) starts or stops playing a track forward the 
event to RabbitMQ for further action. 

In my case, turn power amps on/off using the WeMo power socket they are connected to - topic of another repository <-tba->.

I'm not an Objective-C programmer so I'm sure this is ugly code. But maybe somebody will find it handy.
